# Resale Value Finder
### --> a bot which, given a list of any specific brands or clothing items, searches every possible eBay listing associated while cross checking prices from Stockx and Grailed to find the best value item. 
### --> Value is largely determined by possible resale value determined by past sales and current listings of the same or similar items. 

###### TODO:
    
    -make size param
    
    -make place bid function
    
    -make highest bid function, setting max bid
    
    -REST API implementation? whereas you can add to a running list something like "Palace Hoodie, <$40" and be notified when one is found
    
    -find more efficent way to cross check stockx prices without selenium yet still evading bot detection
      --> mechanize in js?
      --> beautiful soup with implemented wait times?
